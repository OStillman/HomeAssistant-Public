# My Hardware

## Main Server

A Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB of RAM. More than enough to get going with Home Assistant, PiHole etc. I'm running 4 containers and it's barely breaking a sweat. 

I'd recommend the Starter kit from [The PiHut](https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-starter-kit?variant=20336446046270) as the Pi4 is famous for being picky about Power Supplies

Alongside the Start Kit I've also Purchased:

- Argon One M.2 Case - The best case about in my opinion
- 120GB SSD - SD Cards WILL get ruined by Home Assistant
- Raspberry Pi OS - Keeping it simple and customsiable

## Other Devices

- Raspberry Pi Zero W - Currently used as a "Teams Status Indicator"!
- Sonoff Zigbee Hub - My Main Zigbee Controller
- Phillips Hue Hub - Off the Shelf, being Phased Out
- Google Home - All around the house, connecting devices to this is a MUST
