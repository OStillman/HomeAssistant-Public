###  My Smart Home Mission Statement

> To Create an Accessible, User Centric, Automation Led Home to Provide an Experience that Benefits all Household Members and Visitors

To bring this out further:

- Accessible: A.k.a it passes the Girlfriend test. Can she use it, does she frustrated by it?
- User Centric - Users need to be able to use, override and understand throughout the entire journey.
- Automation Lead - Using any form of Dashboard/App/Command should be reserved for tasks I can't predict. Otherwise, automate it
- Experience that benefits all - No matter who you are, you need to be able to walk into this house and go about normal tasks without fear and feel the benefit.
