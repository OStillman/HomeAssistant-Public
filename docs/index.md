# Home Assitant + Geek = Smart Home Automations!

![Placeholder](./assets/images/main-dash.png){: align=center}

Welcome to my Smart Home! It's not as full featured as some of the amazing Development going on within the HomeAssistant community, but it's starting to become pretty cluttered. 

With this, I thought I'd make some formal documentation. Mainly to help me with my understanding and quick reference, but also, hopefully, to inspire others!

## My Smart Home Mission Statement
My Smart Home is coming along nicely, and there's always aspirations and visions. To focus myself, I've created the following Mission Statement for my Smart Home Development:

> To Create an Accessible, User Centric, Automation Lead Home to Provide an Experience that Benefits all Household Members and Visitors

To bring this out further:

- Accessible: I don't want the sort of knowledge I have to be required to make any use of the Smarts, everyone needs to be able to use it
- User Centric - Users need to be able to use, override and understand throughout the entire journey
- Automation Lead - The main point. Switching a light switch to a "Hey Google" command or to require an app load isn't smart, it's annoying. Let's avoid that by automating the simple, predictable tasks
- Experience that benefits all - No matter who you are, you need to be able to walk into this house, and go about normal tasks without fear and feel the benefit

I put a big focus on anything I do being useful to all, which is why I also have my own simple Development Methodology explained here...
