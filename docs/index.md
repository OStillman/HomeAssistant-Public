Hello! My Personal Site is now dedicated to my Smart Home Development, but you can still find out a bit about me here

## Smart Home?

I run Home Assistant as my main Smart-stuff driver. It's nowhere near full-featured but it's becoming ever more useful as time goes on, so what better time to start documenting my actions?!

If you have never heard of Home Assistant, I would recommend taking a look [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/) - it's quite literally amazing

## My Smart Home Mission Statement
My Smart Home is coming along nicely, and there's always aspirations and visions. To focus myself, I have created the following Mission Statement for my Smart Home Development:

> To Create an Accessible, User Centric, Automation Led Home to Provide an Experience that Benefits all Household Members and Visitors

To bring this out further:

- Accessible: I do not want the sort of knowledge I have to be required to make any use of the Smarts; everyone needs to be able to use it
- User Centric - Users need to be able to use, override and understand throughout the entire journey.
- Automation Lead - The main point. Switching a light switch to a "Hey Google" command or to require an app load is not smart, it is annoying. Let us avoid that by automating the simple, predictable tasks!
- Experience that benefits all - No matter who you are, you need to be able to walk into this house and go about normal tasks without fear and feel the benefit.

I put a big focus on anything I do being useful to all, which is why I also have my own simple Development Methodology explained here...
