## What is Home Assistant?

Home Assistant is my Main Smart Home System. I've chosen this because:

- It's simple to setup - Docker Images mean Pull & Deploy
- Active Community - Reddit, Forums etc. 
- Compatability - Pretty much all devices work with it, AND there's loads of open source add-ons that have implementations for Home Assistant!

I've then paired Home Assitant with Node-Red. Which brings visual Automation Flows.

So we have two main systems running:

- Home Assitant - The Integration & State Reporting Platform
- Node-Red - The Logical Automations Platform

!!! tip
    Node-Red is optional. You can use the Home Assitant UI Config or even dive into the YAML files. I've chosen Node-Red as I want to quickly link things up and carry on, I can't afford to spend too much time tinkering!
