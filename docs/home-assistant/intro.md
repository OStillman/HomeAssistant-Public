# My Home Assistant
The most Interesting Part, and main reason for the existance of this documentation, is my Home Assistant Server

## What is Home Assistant?
For those that don't know, I'd recommend taking a look around their [website](https://www.home-assistant.io/). 

But to outline some of the main features:

- Open source - Anyone can see the code, edit the code and make additions to the code
- Interepobility - Thousands of Addons and Integrations allow you to bring all the devices from different manufacturers together. This opens up a whole world of possibilities including:
    - Automation Across Device Eco-Systems i.e. Hue Controlled Lightbulbs via Smart Life Sensor
    - One App for all actions
    - Larger selection of devices - No more concern about adding yet another app that won't work with other devices

It truly is amazing, and we've really only scratched the surface.

### What do I need to run it?

- A Raspberry Pi 4 (I use a 2GB version, but any of the versions will work nicely)
- An SD card (at least, to start off. Look to upgrade to an SSD/HDD)
- Any OS. I recommend keeping it simple and using either Raspberry Pi OS or Home Assistant OS


### What do I use?
My Home Assistant Setup is as simple as it comes:

- 1 Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB)
- Raspberry Pi OS
- Home Assistant installed Via Docker (Honestly, go the docker route if not using the Home Assistant OS, it's so much easier!)
