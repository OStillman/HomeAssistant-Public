# Updates
A "blog" of sorts of the weeks progress. I'll try and keep this as up-to-date as possible!

## W/E 28/03/2021
Tickering this week has been largely around Testing the possibility of removing the Phillips Hue and Automations on the Speaker On/Off Actions. 

**Removing the Hue Hub**
I'm testing the possibility of this at the moment, simple test at this stage to see if it's possible by transferring my Office Light from Hue to my ZHA. Currently working fairly well so investigations continue

**Speaker On/Off Action**
I've FINALLY got a big enough extension lead to let me smart-plug-up my TV Speaker. Added functionality to:

- Turn on when we use the Chromecast
- Change the TV Audio to Optical on Turn on, and back again when we turn it off
- Turn off at night
- Turn off when the TV is turned off

This now enters testing phase to see if it's useful!
